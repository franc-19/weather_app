## Description  
The **Weather App** is a Python-based application that provides real-time weather information for any location worldwide. It uses APIs to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly format. This project is designed to demonstrate the integration of Python with APIs and frameworks to create practical, user-centric applications.  

---

## Features  
- Fetch current weather information by city name, coordinates, or postal code.  
- Displays temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speed.  
- User-friendly interface designed for clarity and ease of use.  
- Error handling for invalid inputs or API errors.  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Framework**: Flask (or Streamlit)  
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API (or any chosen weather API)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `requests`: For API calls.  
  - `flask` or `streamlit`: For the web interface (if applicable).  
  - `dotenv`: For managing API keys securely.

   ```  

3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. Set up the `.env` file for API keys:  
   ```bash  
   echo "API_KEY=your_api_key" > .env  
   ```  

5. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py
